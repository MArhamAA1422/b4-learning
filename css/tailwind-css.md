## Intro
- Tailwind is a utility-first CSS framework.

- Tailwind CSS works by scanning all of your HTML files, JavaScript components, and any other templates for class names, generating the corresponding styles and then writing them to a static CSS file.

- It's fast, flexible, and reliable — with zero-runtime.

## colors

In Tailwind, colors are defined in shades from 50 (lightest) → 900 (darkest).

- `bg-red-100` = very light pinkish red

- `bg-red-500` = medium/standard red

- `bg-red-900` = very dark red

### 500 is like the "base shade" (most balanced)
