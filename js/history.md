## 1995 — Birth of JavaScript

- **Brendan Eich** (at Netscape) created JavaScript in just **10 days**.
- Originally called **Mocha**, then **LiveScript**, finally **JavaScript** (a marketing trick to ride on Java’s popularity).
- First shipped in **Netscape Navigator 2.0**.

Goal: Make web pages interactive (simple scripting, like form validation).

## 1996–1997 — Standardization

- Microsoft made its own version called **JScript** (for Internet Explorer).
- Chaos: Different browsers had incompatible versions.
- 1997 → JavaScript was submitted to **ECMA International** → standardized as **ECMAScript** (ES).
- **ES1 (1997)** → First official version.

## 1998–1999 — Early Growth

- **ES2 (1998)** → minor updates.
- **ES3 (1999)** → Big one: added regex, `try...catch`, better string handling.
- Widely adopted → became the baseline for many years.

## 2000–2008 — The “Dark Ages”

- **ES4** was proposed (classes, modules, etc.), but too ambitious. It failed.
- Browser wars: IE dominated, but each browser implemented JS differently.
- Developers struggled → needed polyfills, hacks.

## 2009 — Revival (ES5)

- **ES5 released** (major update):

  - `strict mode`
  - `JSON` support
  - Array methods (`forEach`, `map`, `filter`, `reduce`)
  - Object methods (`Object.keys`, `Object.defineProperty`)
- Stable, became the foundation of modern JS.


## 2015 — The Revolution (ES6 / ECMAScript 2015)

- The biggest update ever → called **ES6 (ECMAScript 2015)**.
- Introduced:

  - `let`, `const`
  - Arrow functions
  - Classes
  - Modules (`import`/`export`)
  - Template literals
  - Destructuring
  - Promises
  - `Map`, `Set`, `WeakMap`, `WeakSet`
- Made JS powerful enough for serious application development.

## 2016–Present — Yearly Releases

Instead of waiting years, new features are now added **yearly**:

- **ES7 (2016)** → `Array.includes`, `**` exponent operator.
- **ES8 (2017)** → `async/await`, Object methods.
- **ES9 (2018)** → rest/spread for objects, async iteration.
- **ES10 (2019)** → `flat`, `flatMap`, optional `catch`.
- **ES11 (2020)** → `BigInt`, `nullish coalescing (??)`, `optional chaining (?.)`.
- **ES12 (2021)** → `replaceAll`, logical assignment.
- **ES13 (2022)** → top-level `await`.
- **ES14 (2023)** → new array methods (`findLast`, `toSorted`, etc.).

## Today

- JavaScript is the **most widely used language** in the world.
- Runs in browsers, servers (**Node.js**), databases, mobile apps, IoT, even AI frameworks.
- Powered by **modern engines** like V8 (Google), SpiderMonkey (Mozilla).
- Ecosystem: npm, React, Vue, Angular, Express, etc.

## Summary Timeline

- **1995**: Created (Netscape, Brendan Eich).
- **1997**: Standardized as ECMAScript (ES1).
- **1999**: ES3 → stable foundation.
- **2009**: ES5 → JSON, strict mode, array methods.
- **2015**: ES6 → modern JS revolution.
- **2016+**: Yearly updates → async/await, BigInt, optional chaining, etc.
